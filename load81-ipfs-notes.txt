About:
------

The idea is to have LOAD81 as a 'front-end' to as much of the
IPFS ecosystem as feasible, and eventually .. save and serve 
LOAD81 scripts from IPFS, itself.


TODO:
-----

	Use cpp-ipfs-http-client
	https://github.com/vasild/cpp-ipfs-http-client.git
	
	Expose as much as possible to LOAD81's Lua VM.
